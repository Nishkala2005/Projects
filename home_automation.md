# IoT-Based Secure Home Automation Controller

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents the design and development of a **secure IoT-enabled home automation system** that enables intelligent control of household appliances such as lighting, fans, and door access. The system is built around the **ESP32 microcontroller**, leveraging its integrated Wi-Fi capabilities for real-time remote monitoring and control.

A key highlight of the system is the integration of **biometric authentication (fingerprint module)** to enhance security for door access, making it suitable for modern smart home environments. The system supports **multi-mode operation**, including manual control, remote control via IoT, and automated logic-based control.
